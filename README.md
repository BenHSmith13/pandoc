**Disclaimer:** this project is not ready for prime time ; if you need to
call pandoc (the Haskell program) from Python right now, you'd better 
consider other options (such as: pypandoc, os.system, sh, etc.).

The goal of this project is to provide a Pythonic model for pandoc documents 
to enable Python developer to inspect, query, transform them with familiar 
methods.
