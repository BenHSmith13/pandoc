Iteration
================================================================================

Need to explain direct access beforehand. So the "iteration" title is not
appropriate ? Go for "Indexing and Iteration ?". Mmmm ...

TODO :

  - `[:]` or `for in` vs `iter` (children vs descendants)

  - `iter` (examples, use `NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE` when appropriate)

  - `iter` manages dicts (and strings) differently, explain

  - explain `path` iteration and info. 

!!! note "TODO"
    Document the in-place modification scheme that work: lookahead or locate
    then alter in reverse document order.
