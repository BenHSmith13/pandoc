Getting started
================================================================================


The [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) command-line tool needs to be available. 
You may follow [the official installation instructions](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
which are OS-dependent, or if you are a [conda](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=conda+python) user, do

    $ conda install -c conda-forge pandoc

Then, install the latest version of the pandoc Python library with pip:

    $ pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/boisgera/pandoc.git
